 in an engaging grid layout with hover effects and project details. Finally, a "Contact" section provides multiple ways to get in touch.

The dark theme uses deep grays and blacks as the foundation, with a vibrant accent color (likely teal or green) to highlight important elements and create visual interest. Typography is clean and modern, optimized for readability on dark backgrounds. Subtle animations and transitions enhance the user experience without being distracting, creating a portfolio that feels both youthful and professional.

The design maintains consistency across all sections while allowing each to have its own character through varied layouts and interaction patterns. The overall aesthetic is contemporary and tech-forward, perfect for a high school student looking to showcase their work and skills in a memorable way.
